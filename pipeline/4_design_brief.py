PHASE 4: Design brief. The last step of the pipeline: from the coded extracts to a short PDF of design requirements for a design team.

1. Triage (computed, no model). For each sub-theme: reviews that mention it, tone of its extracts, and odds ratio of the outcome
   (e.g. recommending the game) for reviews that mention it (Haldane-corrected, Fisher's exact test, Benjamini-Hochberg).
   Repair first = more negative than positive extracts and lower odds; Accepted friction = more negative, higher odds;
   Protect = more positive, higher odds; Contested = more positive, lower odds; Not decisive = no significant association.
2. Drafts (one model call per priority). The model reads the evidence and up to 40 numbered extracts and writes a short requirement,
   the reason, a possible change and what to check in later reviews. It picks quotes by number, so quotes stay verbatim;
   quotes in another language get a translation, marked as such.
3. Synthesis (one model call). The model reads all drafts together, writes a three-sentence summary and flags tensions between
   priorities. It may only cite the IDs of the priorities, which are checked.
4. PDF. Numbers, quotes and layout come from this script, never from the model. The PDF is compiled with tectonic, xelatex or
   pdflatex if one is installed; otherwise the .tex file is left ready to compile.

Outputs in the output directory: design_brief.json (all evidence, drafts, prompts' inputs and the source of every quote),
design_brief.tex, design_brief.pdf.

Optional "design_brief" block in the configuration (defaults in brackets):
  model [models.harmonizer], language of the brief [English], outcome: metadata key of a 0/1 outcome [voted_up],
  outcome_label [recommending the game], alpha [0.05], max_extracts [40], title [Design brief], input: extracts file
  [the reassigned file if present, otherwise the final file]. Written for languages in Latin script.

Usage: python 4_design_brief.py --config study_config_sample.json

- requirement: one sentence, at most 25 words, testable.

- proposed_change: at most 30 words. It is a hypothesis.
